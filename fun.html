                <h2>Hobby 1: Yoyo</h2>

                <p>I have played with the yoyo on and off for almost 10 years now.
                    I first started when I was around 11 years old, and tried to learn as many tricks as I could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I find new tricks to be exceedingly difficult to learn, but I still practice occasionally so I don't forget the tricks I have learned.
                    I also enjoy watching the <a target="_blank" href="http://wyyc2021.com/">World Yoyo Contest</a> to see the crazy tricks some people can do that I could never even attempt.

                </p>

                <h2 class = "clearLeft">Hobby 2: Longboarding</h2>
                <img class = "float" width="200" height="300" src = "photos/LongboardZoom.jpg" alt = "Longboard Picture">
                <p>I occasionally like to take my longboard out for a ride. 
                    <br>
                    I find that it's a good way to get outside after being coped up inside all day doing online classes.
                    <br>
                    Someday I would also like to invest in an electric longboard.</p>

                <h2 class = "clearLeft">Hobby 3: Ping Pong</h2>
                <img class = "float" width="220" height="300" src = "photos/PingPong2.jpg" alt = "Ping Pong Picture">
                <p>I enjoy playing Ping Pong with my two younger borthers. We get seriously competitive.</p>

                <h2 class = "clearLeft">Our Family Pet Snake</h2>
                <p>Allow me to introduce our pet snake, affectionately referred to as "the Snake", or "Snaky".</p>
                <img class = "float" width="340" height="340" src = "photos/SnakeSnapshot.jpg" alt = "Headshot of the Snake">
                <img class = "floatRight" width="260" height="340" src = "photos/SnakeHolding.jpg" alt = "Me holding the Snake">
                <p>He (at least I think it's a he, nobody knows for sure) enjoys eating mice and taking the occasional soak in his tub.
                    While he may look threatening at times, especially since he is now almost 6 ft long, he is in fact a docile, nonvenomous Bullsnake.
                </p>
                <p>One of the nice things about our snake is that he requires very little care. All he needs is to be feed and cleaned once a week. 
                    In addition, over the winter, the snake enters a state of semi-hibernation, where he lowers his body temperature and doesn't eat or do anything for more than 3 months.

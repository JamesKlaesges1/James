                    <b>Single Sign On (SSO) Integration:</b>
                    <br>
                    Researched, designed, and implemented a configurable SSO integration for users signing in to the License Management system.
                    <br>
                    Utilized .NET with SAML authentication for a secure FedRAMP compliant login process.
					<br>
					Fully configurable, this integration supports most SAML 2.0 identity providers to allow users the ease of single sign on.
                </p>
				
				<p>
                    <b>Education Platform Integration:</b>
                    <br>
                    Researched, designed, and implemented a configurable integration with two third-party education systems: Moodle and Brainier.
                    <br>
                    Added a .NET API and background scheduled tasks to move data to and from the education system.
					<br>
					This allows clients to sync courses, attendees, credits, and other education information in License Management to the education system.
                </p>
				
				<p>
                    <b>Login and Profile Rewrite:</b>
                    <br>
                    Redesigned and rewrote high-traffic pages in the system, including the login, dashboard, and profile pages.
                    <br>
                    Improved performance, utility, and appearance of these pages using React and .NET

                        <b>Purpose:</b>
                        <br>
                        Create a video game based on the Super Mario series which incorporates player interaction, camera movement, and enemy AI behavior.
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        Researched, designed, and tested a videogame using Unity Game engine and C#.
                        <br>
                        I also made it compatible with both Android and WebGL platforms.
                        I plan on expanding this game by bugfixing and adding more levels and features, such as a timer and point system.

                        This app is still under development and being tested, as there are numerous apps that could be running in the background of a person's phone that tend to offset the statistics.

                    <br>
                    For my final Senior Project, I worked in a team of 5 on a large-scale, remote learning web application called "Spock".
                    <br>
                    This application allows teachers to log in, create courses, and upload lectures. Students can then log in to watch lectures and create notes and comments.
                    <br>
                    For this project, I made updates to the javascript and ran automated unit tests using JUnit.
                    <br>
                    I also followed the Agile Methodology in a series of cycles and code reviews, using Git as a version control system.

                    There are additional map controls, map markers, and crime filters for the user.

                        Using Javascript, NodeJS, and SQLite, my team and I created a dynamic website that queries information from a US energy database to allow a user to analyze data by year, state, or resource.
                        <br>
                        Our website then uses that information to dynamically generate tables, charts, and images according to the selected year, state, or resource.
